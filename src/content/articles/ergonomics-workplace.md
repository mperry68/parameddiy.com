## What is Ergonomics?

Ergonomics is the science of designing and arranging things people use so that the people and things interact most efficiently and safely. In the workplace, ergonomics focuses on fitting the job to the worker, rather than forcing the worker to fit the job.

## Why Workplace Ergonomics Matters

Poor ergonomics can lead to:

- Musculoskeletal disorders
- Repetitive strain injuries
- Back and neck pain
- Eye strain
- Fatigue and decreased productivity

Good ergonomics can:

- Reduce injury risk
- Improve comfort
- Increase productivity
- Enhance overall wellbeing
- Prevent long-term health problems

## Setting Up Your Desk

### Monitor Position

- **Height**: Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- **Distance**: About an arm's length away (20-26 inches)
- **Angle**: Slightly tilted back (10-20 degrees)
- **Brightness**: Adjust to comfortable level, reduce glare

### Keyboard and Mouse

- **Keyboard Height**: Elbows at 90-110 degrees, wrists straight
- **Mouse Position**: Close to keyboard, same height
- **Wrist Support**: Use a wrist rest if helpful, but don't rest wrists while typing
- **Keyboard Tilt**: Slight negative tilt (front higher than back)

### Chair Setup

- **Seat Height**: Feet flat on floor, knees at 90 degrees
- **Back Support**: Lumbar support at curve of lower back
- **Armrests**: Adjust so shoulders are relaxed, elbows at 90 degrees
- **Seat Depth**: 2-4 inches between back of knees and seat edge

### Desk Height

- **Standard Desk**: 28-30 inches high
- **Adjustable Desk**: Set so forearms are parallel to floor when typing
- **Standing Desk**: Monitor at eye level, keyboard at elbow height

## Proper Posture

### Sitting Posture

- Sit back in your chair with back supported
- Keep feet flat on floor or on a footrest
- Shoulders relaxed, not hunched
- Head balanced over shoulders
- Elbows close to body, at 90-110 degrees

### Standing Posture

- Stand with weight evenly distributed
- Keep shoulders back and relaxed
- Head balanced over shoulders
- Slight bend in knees
- Wear supportive shoes

## Taking Breaks

### Micro-Breaks

Take short breaks every 30-60 minutes:

- Look away from screen for 20 seconds
- Stand up and stretch
- Walk around briefly
- Change position

### Regular Breaks

Every 2 hours:

- Take a 5-10 minute break
- Walk around
- Stretch major muscle groups
- Rest your eyes

### Eye Care
