## Introduction to Post-Surgical Rehabilitation

Rehabilitation after surgery is a crucial part of the recovery process. It helps restore function, reduce pain, prevent complications, and return you to your normal activities as safely and quickly as possible.

## Why Rehabilitation Matters

Post-surgical rehabilitation is important because:

- It helps restore strength and mobility
- Reduces the risk of complications
- Prevents muscle atrophy and joint stiffness
- Improves circulation and healing
- Helps you return to daily activities safely

## The Rehabilitation Timeline

### Immediate Post-Operative Phase (Days 1-7)

During the first week after surgery:

- Focus is on pain management
- Early mobilization as tolerated
- Basic range of motion exercises
- Wound care and monitoring
- Education about activity restrictions

### Early Rehabilitation Phase (Weeks 2-6)

As healing progresses:

- Gradual increase in activity level
- More active range of motion exercises
- Beginning of strengthening exercises
- Gait training if applicable
- Continued education and support

### Intermediate Phase (Weeks 6-12)

Building on early progress:

- Progressive strengthening program
- Functional movement training
- Balance and coordination work
- Endurance training
- Return to work or sport preparation

### Advanced Phase (Months 3-6+)

Final stages of recovery:

- Sport-specific or work-specific training
- Advanced strengthening
- Full return to activities
- Maintenance program
- Long-term management strategies

## Common Types of Post-Surgical Rehabilitation

- Progressive resistance training
- Functional strengthening
- Core stability work
- Eccentric and concentric training

### Balance and Proprioception

Restoring balance and body awareness:

- Single-leg standing
- Balance board exercises
- Proprioceptive training
- Coordination drills
- Functional balance activities

### Functional Training

Preparing for return to daily activities:
