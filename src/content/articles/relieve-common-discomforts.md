## Hiccups: Causes and Remedies

### What Causes Hiccups

Hiccups occur when the diaphragm (the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen) contracts involuntarily, followed by sudden closure of the vocal cords. Common triggers include:

- Eating too quickly
- Drinking carbonated beverages
- Sudden temperature changes
- Excitement or stress
- Swallowing air

### How to Stop Hiccups Fast

**Breathing Techniques**
- **Hold your breath** - Take a deep breath and hold for 10-20 seconds
- **Breathe into a paper bag** - Increases carbon dioxide, may reset diaphragm
- **Slow, controlled breathing** - Focus on deep, steady breaths

**Water Techniques**
- **Sip cold water slowly** - Can interrupt the hiccup reflex
- **Drink from the opposite side of the glass** - Changes swallowing pattern
- **Gargle with cold water** - Stimulates the vagus nerve

**Diaphragm Stimulation**
- **Pull your knees to your chest** - Compresses the diaphragm
- **Lean forward** - Changes diaphragm position
- **Gentle pressure** - Apply light pressure to the area just below your breastbone

**Other Techniques**
- **Sugar** - Swallow a teaspoon of sugar (may stimulate the vagus nerve)
- **Vinegar** - A small amount may interrupt the reflex
- **Distraction** - Sometimes focusing on something else helps

Most hiccups resolve within minutes to an hour. If hiccups persist for more than 48 hours, consult a healthcare provider.
